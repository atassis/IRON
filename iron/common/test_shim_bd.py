"""Tests for the shared ShimNOC BD run-split helper.

The point of the shared helper is that one hardware invariant has one implementation. The
differential test below is what makes that claim checkable: it pins the helper against the
inline algorithm `repeat` used before the extraction, over the whole parameter range rather
than a few chosen shapes.
